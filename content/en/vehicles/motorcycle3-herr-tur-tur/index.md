Originally, we had [Kazuko](/vehicles/motorcycle1-kazuko/) and [Raven](/vehicles/motorcycle2-raven/) as our two motorcycles for the big journey. But when we found our [Mammothon](/vehicles/exmo/), it became clear that we had to reduce weight – and the 700cc CFMoto was simply too heavy.

So now we're traveling the world with [Raven](/vehicles/motorcycle2-raven/) and Herr Tur Tur*.

Oh yes, the name. Herr Tur Tur is a "Scheinriese" – he has a lot in common with the big GS models from BMW, and at first glance, many see a large, powerful touring machine. But if you look closely, he's super light and has a few horsepower less than the >1000cc machines most people associate with a GS.
