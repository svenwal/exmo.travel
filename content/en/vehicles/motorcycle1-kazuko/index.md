For our first motorcycle, we decided on a [CFMoto 700CL-X Adventure](https://cfmoto-motorcycle.eu/de/de/motorcycles/classic/700cl-x-adventure). We were looking for a relatively lightweight adventure bike with modern technology, moderate off-road capabilities, low seat height, suitable for the A license, and beginner-friendly.
