**Disclaimer:**

**Liability for Content**

The contents of our pages were created with great care. However, we cannot guarantee the accuracy, completeness, and timeliness of the content. As a service provider, we are responsible for our own content on these pages in accordance with general laws according to § 7 Abs.1 DDG. According to §§ 8 to 10 DDG, as a service provider, we are not obliged to monitor transmitted or stored external information or to investigate circumstances that indicate illegal activity. Obligations to remove or block the use of information in accordance with general laws remain unaffected. However, liability in this regard is only possible from the time of knowledge of a specific legal violation. Upon becoming aware of such legal violations, we will remove this content immediately.

**Liability for Links**

Our offer contains links to external websites of third parties, on whose contents we have no influence. Therefore, we cannot assume any liability for these external contents. The respective provider or operator of the pages is always responsible for the contents of the linked pages. The linked pages were checked for possible legal violations at the time of linking. Illegal contents were not recognizable at the time of linking. A permanent content control of the linked pages is, however, not reasonable without concrete evidence of a violation. Upon becoming aware of legal violations, we will remove such links immediately.

**Data Protection**

The use of our website is generally possible without providing personal data. Insofar as personal data (such as name, address, or email addresses) are collected on our pages, this is always done on a voluntary basis, as far as possible. These data will not be passed on to third parties without your express consent.  
We point out that data transmission on the Internet (e.g., when communicating by email) can have security gaps. A complete protection of the data from access by third parties is not possible.  
The use of contact data published as part of the imprint obligation by third parties for sending unsolicited advertising and information materials is hereby expressly prohibited. The operators of the pages expressly reserve the right to take legal action in the event of the unsolicited sending of advertising information, such as spam emails.
