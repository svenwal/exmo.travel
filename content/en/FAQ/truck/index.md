When it comes to technology, many factors come into play. Let's start with the expedition vehicle itself:

## The Chassis

Since we haven't purchased our vehicle yet, we can only outline our thoughts so far. Itâ€™s clear that we want to live in our vehicle for several years, so the living space should be sufficiently large. This quickly leads to the conclusion that it needs to be a "real truck" over 7.5 tons.

Moreover, the chassis needs to be robust and off-road capable, and repairs should be possible even in the most remote corners of the world. Based on these parameters, we have narrowed down the selection to a Mercedes Arocs or a MAN TGM/TGS.

Regarding the question of new or used: We tend to lean towards new, as this would mean having comfort and technology up to the current standards, and previous owners haven't worn anything out yet. Of course, this comes with the disadvantages of price and more electronics. In the end, we might still opt for used if we find "the perfect vehicle" already fully equipped.

## The Cabin

The bigger, the more space. But also more costs, more overhang, or an additional axle. A tricky decision.

Throughout the planning process, we have fluctuated between a length of about 6 meters on a 4x4 chassis or a 7-meter length on a 6x6 chassis.

If money were no object (or we got really lucky on the used market), a 6x6 chassis with a 7-meter cabin would be the first choice. However, this would also entail higher running costs (ferries, tires, etc.), so it's questionable.

The layout and materials are crucial for us, as we plan to live in it for years, so it has to fit.

## Gas or No Gas?

Short answer: no gas. Everything electric (with solar panels) and heating via diesel.

Why no gas? It would need to be securely stored somewhere, secured or even emptied on ferries and such, and it simply increases complexity with another component.
