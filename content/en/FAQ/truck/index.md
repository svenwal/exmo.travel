When it comes to the technical aspects, many factors play a role. Let's start with the expedition mobile itself:

## The Chassis

When we bought our truck, our thought process was as follows: It was clear that we wanted to live in our vehicle for several years, so the living space had to be of a corresponding size. From this, it quickly became clear that it had to be a "real truck" over 7.5 tons.

Furthermore, the chassis had to be robust and off-road capable, and a repair should be possible even in the most remote corners of the world. Based on these parameters, the selection was narrowed down to a Mercedes Arocs or MAN TGM/TGS.

Regarding the question of new or used: We initially tended towards new, as we would then have the latest in comfort and technology, and previous owners wouldn't have broken anything. Of course, this comes with the disadvantages of price and more electronics. In the end, however, it became a used one, as we found "the perfect mobile" already completely used.

## The Cabin

The bigger, the more space. But also more costs, more overhang, or another axle. A difficult matter.

Throughout the entire planning process, we wavered between a length of around 6m on a 4x4 chassis or a 7m length on a 6x6 chassis.

If money were no object, a 6x6 chassis with a 7m cabin would have been the first choice. However, that comes with higher running costs (ferries, tires, ...) and also limited maneuverability.

What is essential for us is the layout and the materials - since we want to live in it for years, it has to be just right.

## Gas or no gas?

Short answer: no gas. Everything is electric (with solar power) and heating is via diesel.

Why no gas? It would have to be stored securely somewhere, it would have to be secured or even emptied on ferries and the like, and it simply increases complexity with another component.
