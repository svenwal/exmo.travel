Since June 2025, we have been on the road without a rigid schedule.

It is certain that we will initially stay in Europe or the immediate vicinity (for logistical and other reasons), but after that, depending on the global political situation, we will travel to other continents.

We also don't want to be forced into a fixed routine - where we like it, we will stay longer - where we don't, we will leave more quickly.
