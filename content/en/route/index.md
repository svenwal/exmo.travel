The goal is the world - we want to travel Europe, Asia, America and Africa if possible. When we will be where depends on the current situation in the respective countries.

We started our journey by crossing Europe — taking it slow, getting used to life on the road, and testing everything while still in familiar surroundings.

Before heading far away from workshops and easy roads, a few first days in Africa will expand our radius over the winter.

The flags on [our homepage|(/en) will give you hints about where we’re heading — the [blog](/en/post) is always a few weeks behind…

We want to circumnavigate Africa if possible (down the west coast, up the east coast) - if the political situation allows it.

Asia as an idea via Turkey, then if possible Iran, various Stan states and then further east.

America the Pan-America - with both Canada and the USA maximized in terms of visas (so that we can also do an east-west tour in each country).
