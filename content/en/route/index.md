> Currently we are in Germany and planning our trip - so it has not yet begun!

The goal is the world - we want to travel Europe, Asia, America and Africa if possible. When we will be where depends on the current situation in the respective countries.

We will most likely start by crossing Europe - slowly getting used to the known environment and testing everything before we go far away from workshops and easy roads.

We want to circumnavigate Africa if possible (down the west coast, up the east coast) - if the political situation allows it.

Asia as an idea via Turkey, then if possible Iran, various Stan states and then further east.

America the Pan-America - with both Canada and the USA maximized in terms of visas (so that we can also do an east-west tour in each country).
