Another big step for the journey is complete – we both now have our motorcycle licenses (Class A) and have already been able to take some first (local only) trips. These are the first rides as we envision them over the coming years, marking what feels like the start of Season 0 of our journey.

It all took a bit longer than expected (due to external factors), but now it’s done, and we've taken our first rides in the currently golden October with [和子 Kazuko](/vehicles/motorcycle1-kazuko/).
