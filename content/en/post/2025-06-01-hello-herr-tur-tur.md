   We faced a tough decision: now that [our expedition vehicle](/vehicles/exmo) has been chosen (more on that very soon here!), a problem emerged: our Mammothon already has a large lift for motorcycles (which is great – because those are seriously expensive!) – but weight-wise, our two motorcycles plus the spare tire just won’t fit.

   And after long, agonizing deliberations, we’ve now sold [Kazuko](/vehicles/motorcycle1-kazuko/) and downsized significantly (especially in terms of weight).

We faced a tough decision: now that [our expedition vehicle](/vehicles/exmo) has been chosen (more on that very soon here!), a problem emerged: our Mammothon already has a large lift for motorcycles (which is great – because those are seriously expensive!) – but weight-wise, our two motorcycles plus the spare tire just won’t fit.

And after long, agonizing deliberations, we’ve now sold [Kazuko](/vehicles/motorcycle1-kazuko/) and downsized significantly (especially in terms of weight). For just under a week now, [Herr Tur Tur](/vehicles/motorcycle3-herr-tur-tur/) has been with us – a [BMW G 310 GS](https://www.adac.de/rund-ums-fahrzeug/zweirad/motorrad-roller/fahrberichte/bmw-g-310-gs/). We've already completed the first 500 km of “test rides” and we’re very happy with our choice, which allows us to shed about 50 kg in weight.
