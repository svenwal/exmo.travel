Obviously, a large truck is not always the first choice to get into tight inner cities or other hard-to-reach places. So how do you get around there? With the motorcycle, of course!

As we both did not have motorcycles before, we decided to venture into the world of motorized two-wheelers. Our first choice was the [CFMoto 700CL-X](https://cfmoto-motorcycle.eu/de/de/motorcycles/classic/700cl-x-adventure), which we liked the most after some research and test drives.

We have named her [和子 Kazuko](/vehicles/motorcycle1-kazuko/).

This also includes the appropriate driver's license - we have now both started this and I have uploaded a first video of the first driving attempts on our YouTube channel - the topic is "basic driving tasks":
