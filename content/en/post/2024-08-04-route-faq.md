After this site went live and we received some initial feedback, I have compiled the most frequently asked questions into a [FAQ section](/faq).

The most important information is that we are **not yet on the road**. We are still in the preparation phase and have quite a bit to do before we can start.

I have also added a new page where I present the planned [route of our world trip](/route). Of course, as of today, this is still very rough and subject to change. But this gives you a general idea of where we plan to go.
