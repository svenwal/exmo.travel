Part of the planning for the big trip is a full-size truck that can take us to remote areas. Of course, this also requires the appropriate driver's license. We both already have a driver's license that allows us to drive trucks up to 7.5t, but that is not enough for what we have in mind.

Today I took my class C driver's license at Dekra - from now on I am allowed to drive trucks over 7.5t. That was a big step and I am glad it worked out.
