After many years of dreaming, planning, comparing, and finally a lot of paperwork, we finally brought our future mobile home home this weekend.

When we saw the Mammothon live for the first time, we instantly fell in love — it was so close to our ideal vision and already fully ready "to go" — we were hooked.

It then took a few more months until everything was organized and signed — but the first night after the purchase was already fantastic, and the drive back the next day through the beautiful Main valley and along the highways felt like a dream come true.

And as the one more thing, it arrived just in time for the [Abenteuer Allrad](https://www.abenteuer-allrad.de/) in Bad Kissingen, and we're already excited to finally be at the [Camp Area](https://www.abenteuer-allrad.de/camp-area) ourselves this year — feel free to stop by!

You can find a few more specs and photos on the [dedicated Mammothon page](/en/vehicles/exmo/) — which will definitely be expanded in the coming weeks.
