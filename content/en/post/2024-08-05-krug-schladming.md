title: "Visiting Krug"
---

We are currently in Austria - more specifically in Styria - on vacation. In addition to the many beautiful hikes and excursions we are doing here, we also have a short trip via the [SÃ¶lkpass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%C3%B6lk_Pass) to [Schladming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schladming) - the home of [Krug Expedition Vehicles](https://www.krugxp.com).

After several meetings at various [Abenteuer Allrad](https://www.abenteuer-allrad.de/) and the [Offroad Event in Biberach](2024-04-30-krug-event), we now had the opportunity to visit the production site, see many sample vehicles, and also exchange ideas with the Krug team.

## The main topics were

* The chassis - especially the (still undecided) question of 4x4 or 6x6 (which is mainly a cost issue) and whether to choose [Mercedes Arocs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercedes-Benz_Arocs) or [MAN TGM](https://www.man.eu/global/en/truck/all-models/the-man-tgm-and-man-tgl/overview/tgm_l-overview.html) / [TGS](https://www.man.eu/global/en/truck/all-models/the-man-tgs/overview/tgs-overview.html).
* The rear carrier for the now planned two motorcycles (each 200 kg plus spare tire) with implications again on the chassis
* The layout - here we were able to take away some really good new ideas and are now mentally moving towards a C-floor plan (see [Catalog](https://krugfiles.the23.info/KRUG_EXPEDITION_SERIES_MODULES_%D0%A1ATALOG_2024:2025.pdf))
* Just gathering impressions and ideas

As always, you take away many new ideas and suggestions, clarify 3 points, and open 4 new ones. But that's the point of it all.

## A few impressions from the yard
