## Erlangen / Schnaittach

After completing all our scheduled appointments in Austria (sounds way too much like work ‚Äì but in between we really enjoyed the mountains), our next destination is the [Netherlands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands). Looking at the map, this means we get to cross all of Germany.

The first destination was [Erlangen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erlangen) (another work-related stop), but we took our time and first only drove as far as [Allershausen](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allershausen), where we chose a parking spot near the cemetery. Once there, we discovered that other campers must have overdone it in the past, because we came across brand-new ‚ÄúNo Camping‚Äù signs. Of course, we respected those and moved to the (huge) local sports complex instead.

We had a very quiet stay here and Lou enjoyed the sun with a good book.

The next day we continued on to the actual destination [Schnaittach](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schnaittach), where, thanks to an insider tip (greetings at this point), we found a large hiking parking lot. Up on the mountain below the fortress but (apart from two other campers) completely empty. Perfect ‚Äì and of course we immediately climbed the mountain and hiked a loop around [Rothenberg Fortress](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rothenberg_(Festung)) with a meal afterwards overlooking the valley.

[Erlangen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erlangen) was then a business appointment ‚Äì and since the weather was good, I was able to do it by motorbike. Everything working pretty smoothly so far.

## Fulda

We continued northeast to [Fulda](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fulda) ‚Äì I had picked this stop because the [Intercity Express](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intercity-Express) runs well through to [Berlin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin), and also because of the beautiful old town from my childhood.

![Old town Fulda](/images/blog/2025-08-germany/Fulda-Altstadt.jpeg)
The old town of [Fulda](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fulda)

The [motorhome parking area](https://www.tourismus-fulda.de/uebernachten-in-fulda/wohnmobilstellplaetze/pois/FLD/b552418b-cc11-4eda-8884-f374c3284ef0/wohnmobilstellplatz--weimarer-strasse-) is very conveniently located between the [(river) Fulda](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fulda_(Fluss)) and the old town ‚Äì right by the garbage collection depot. As soon as we arrived, I quickly walked to the station and headed off to [Berlin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin). On the way back to the [main train station](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin_Hauptbahnhof) after my appointment, I happened to catch the exact moment when [Volodymyr Zelenskyy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volodymyr_Zelenskyy) landed at the Chancellery under maximum security measures. Impressive, but also unsettling that this was necessary.

While I was having business fun with Deutsche Bahn (my outbound train broke down en route and we had to change trains), Saskia and Lou were able to hike through [Fulda](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fulda) from all angles.

Back in [Fulda](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fulda), I also had the chance to explore the old town ‚Äì and in a supermarket we bought a new [Sodastream](https://sodastream.de) (the ‚Äúold‚Äù one was broken). Who could have guessed that they would just change the system so that it became incompatible with my existing CO‚ÇÇ cartridges? On top of that, the expensive thing is also leaking üò° ‚Äì but more on that later...

## Edersee

Inspired by an [article in SPIEGEL Online](https://www.spiegel.de/panorama/edersee-in-hessen-tauchen-versunkene-doerfer-wieder-auf-a-3f94b5d1-abc3-4a4c-9e98-32f810db733c), we continued on to the [Edersee](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edersee) ‚Äì a locally very well-known reservoir that varies greatly in water levels depending on the season. At the time of our visit, it was extremely low, so various old villages and a bridge reappeared ‚Äì yes, the bridge in the photo is normally under water and instead a ferry runs there.

We walk straight across the [Edersee](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edersee)

For our overnight spot, we found the very end of a dead-end road in the middle of nowhere ‚Äì within walking distance of the bridge but in complete tranquility.

## Schermbeck

As the last stop before the border, another hiking parking lot awaited us. It turned out to be another lucky find, the surrounding forest was very diverse and the perfect dog-walking area.
