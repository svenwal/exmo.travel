## Obelink

A new motorhome needs to be equipped ‚Äì and among campers it‚Äôs well known that you can get everything at [Obelink](https://www.obelink.de/). We had never been there before, so it was about time ‚Äì and that was the initial reason for heading to the Netherlands.

For those who have never been there: imagine a huge IKEA (including fixed walking routes and a restaurant) but with everything for camping ‚Äì and I really mean everything!

After a few hours, equipped with some accessories here and there, it was enough, and we were glad that we had picked a small [farm campsite](https://park4night.com/de/place/592710).

So we found ourselves surrounded by greenery in [Zieuwent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zieuwent), able to recover from the bustle.

## Between the Markermeer and the IJsselmeer

Our next stop was on the [Houtribdijk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houtribdijk), which separates the [Markermeer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markermeer) from the [IJsselmeer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IJsselmeer). Right behind us was the large lock system, right in front of us the local beach for surfers ‚Äì we stayed a few days here and enjoyed the atmosphere.

On the other side of the lock (within walking distance) at [Lelystad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lelystad) was a [shopping center](https://www.bataviastad.nl/de), offering everything from candy to good local fries ‚Äì and for dessert [Poffertjes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poffertjes). That same weekend in [Amsterdam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amsterdam) there was the big [harbor festival](https://www.mr-amsterdam.de/blog/veranstaltungen/sail-amsterdam/) ‚Äì unfortunately we missed it, but many ships passed through ‚Äúour‚Äù lock on their way to [Amsterdam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amsterdam).

The local art was at times quite interesting ‚Äì from heads with a man on top to a crouching man (most people see the ‚Äúcrouching‚Äù differently, and locally he is more often called the ["Shitting Man"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exposure_(sculpture))).

## Jachthaven Andijk

A last stop before our northernmost destination was a [marina directly on the IJsselmeer](https://www.jachthavenandijk.nl/) ‚Äì in fact, we are realizing more and more that marinas and expedition vehicles are quite a typical combination ‚Äì the interior construction of boats and expedition vehicles has a lot in common, especially when it comes to built-in technology (electricity, water, etc.).

## In the dunes of Texel

And now for the northernmost turnaround point ‚Äì we had always wanted to camp in the dunes, so after some research (dogs allowed? suitable pitch size?) I found the campsite [De Robbenjager](https://www.duinparkderobbenjager.nl/de/) on [Texel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texel).

![Campsite on Texel](/images/blog/2025-08-netherlands/texel-stellplatz.jpeg)

To be honest, I had picked it without realizing it was actually on an island. So we quickly [booked a ferry](https://www.teso.nl/de/) and crossed the sea.

The campsite is really great ‚Äì I can highly recommend it. You walk straight over the dunes to the beach, you can rent bikes, etc. It is, however, on the pricier side ‚Äì but if you usually stay very cheaply or even free of charge, you can make an exception once in a while.

We had wonderful beach walks, rode the motorcycles all around the island, and Saskia was able to join both a birding expedition and a mudflat tour.

And the saying always holds true: there‚Äôs always a bigger one ‚Äì we ended up next to a [Morelo Grand Empire](https://www.morelo-reisemobile.de/modelle/grand-empire), which first pulled a Porsche out of its rear garage.
