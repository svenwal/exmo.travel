For about two weeks now, we've done it â€“ we're now traveling full-time and living wherever we want to be.

The big day was the week before last â€“ we handed over our sold house and moved into the Mammothon with a lot of last-minute stress. Since I had many off-site appointments that particular week for work, most of the load was on Saskia â€“ sorry ðŸ«¤

Speaking of work â€“ our first drive took us to Messe Berlin, where I was [exhibiting](https://www.wearedevelopers.com/). We stayed on a parking lot in [Grunewald](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grunewald_forest) â€“ just a short walk from the exhibition halls â€“ an exciting day.

After work, we headed south â€“ we want to take things slowly, so we stopped relatively early near [Hof](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hof,_Bavaria) and found a little gem of a spot â€“ including some nice chats with curious passersby.

The next day we headed to our daughter in Kempten (well, almost directly â€“ [Garmin](https://www.garmin.com/de-DE/p/685257/) and I probably won't become friends...), where we stayed on a parking lot that isnâ€™t used on weekends, until it was time to continue to a client meeting on Monday.

After the meeting, we drove just a few kilometers to our old hometown near [Landsberg am Lech](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landsberg_am_Lech) and were lucky to stay on a pasture belonging to a farmer â€“ an organic farm, with cows and their calves right next to us.

While we were here, I also rebuilt the motorcycle platform â€“ the previous design didnâ€™t fit our two bikes. Now theyâ€™re perfectly secured.

Long planned, we then continued to the [Knightsâ€™ Tournament at Kaltenberg Castle](https://www.ritterturnier.de/) â€“ we arrived early and due to a few coincidences, we were allowed by the stewards to park up top with the exhibitors, just a short walk from the entrance. We met up with our daughter and watched mighty knights in their tournament â€“ just like the first time around 30 years ago and a few times in between. Always a pleasure.

We then headed to the Black Forest for a short stop at [KLATrucks](https://www.klatrucks.de/) â€“ a new air horn was installed and a few maintenance tasks were taken care of.

Our final (for now) current location is the [Wilder Kaiser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaiser_mountains) near the [Bergdoktor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Der_Bergdoktor_(2008_TV_series)) filming locations â€“ but not without a short stop in [Landsberg am Lech](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landsberg_am_Lech) to keep the drive manageable.

And now we're parked on a farm high above [Ellmau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellmau) / [Going](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Going_am_Wilden_Kaiser) with a view of the mountains â€“ at least as much as the current rain front allows. Weâ€™ve hiked to the filming locations of the Bergdoktor and even made it up to the alpine pasture.
