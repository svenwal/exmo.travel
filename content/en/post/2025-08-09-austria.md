   Our trip through Austria had several stages â€“ from the Bergdoktor in Ellmau, along the HochalpenstraÃŸe to the GroÃŸglockner, and finally to Krug in Schladming at the Dachstein.

## Ellmau / Wilder Kaiser

We arrived in [Ellmau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellmau) (see [last blog post](2025-07-27-our-journey-has-started/)) â€“ and this was when we could finally start focusing on the actual journey. We set up our temporary home on a small farm and went on day trips, short and long, depending on the weather.

I had already mentioned the [Bergdoktor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Der_Bergdoktor) in the previous post â€“ afterwards we hiked up the Astberg on a longer loop with beautiful views of the [Wilder Kaiser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilder_Kaiser).

The weather was mostly mixed â€“ but at least one day brought blue skies and sunshine, perfect for some photos.

But to be honest, most days looked more like thisâ€¦

![Lots of rain](/images/blog/2025-08-austria/Ellmau-es-regnet.jpeg)  
Heavy rain â€“ even the duck pond overflowed

â€¦so we decided to make another unplanned stop. Marco and Tanja from the [Camping Caravan Podcast](https://www.campingcaravanpodcast.de) kept sending us photos from the [GroÃŸglockner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grossglockner) â€“ all sunny and rain-free.

## GroÃŸglockner / Heiligenblut

So we packed up again and headed for [Heiligenblut](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heiligenblut). Since it was a spontaneous decision, I hadnâ€™t planned everything properly and only realized at the toll booth that the way to [Heiligenblut](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heiligenblut) leads via the [Grossglockner HochalpenstraÃŸe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grossglockner_High_Alpine_Road). Apart from the steep toll fee (charged by the metric ton...), it was a fantastic and educational drive â€“ tight switchbacks, steep climbs and descents â€“ I can handle them now.

At the highest point thereâ€™s a relatively small tunnel (just 4 m clearance in the center)

![Highest point of the HochalpenstraÃŸe](/images/blog/2025-08-austria/Grossglockner-HochalpenstraÃŸe.jpeg)  
Quick stop, nearly froze, then moved on

After many more bends and a bit of searching, we finally arrived at the [campsite in Heiligenblut](https://www.nationalpark-camping.at) â€“ Tanja from the [Camping Caravan Podcast](https://www.campingcaravanpodcast.de) spotted us early.

We got the spot right next to Marco and Tanja â€“ right at the entrance where everyone notices you (and the Mammothon draws attention anyway).

Our pitch

Unfortunately, we seemed to have brought the rain with us â€“ not quite as bad as in [Ellmau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellmau), but still wet. So we headed out on two hikes to waterfalls â€“ youâ€™re getting wet anywayâ€¦

But there were two real highlights:

1. Our evening game nights with Marco and Tanja  
2. Our hike in perfect weather up to the GroÃŸglockner

Yes â€“ we actually had a clear day! The sky opened up more and more during our long hike, and eventually we had an unobstructed view of the summit (and plenty of photos to prove it).

It was both impressive and unsettling â€“ from the foot of the [glacial lake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pasterze_Glacier), signs showed how far the [glacier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pasterze_Glacier) had reached in different years. The impact of climate change is staggering.

It was a wonderful few days at the [GroÃŸglockner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grossglockner). Before leaving, we emptied the wastewater and refilled fresh water (for the first time since setting off 4 weeks earlier!). With low water pressure, filling nearly 600 liters took quite a while...

## Schladming / Krug

Now on to the real reason we came to Austria â€“ we continued to [Schladming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schladming), home of [Krug](https://krugxp.com) (we had already been once last year).

We wanted some modifications done, plus two or three small repairs â€“ so we scheduled a week in [Schladming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schladming).

In the meantime, we stayed in a hotel (strange, when youâ€™re used to living full-time in the Mammothon) â€“ the place had a bit of a spiritual, new-age vibe :)

For me, it was off to a client meeting in Vienna â€“ taking the Ã–BB train from [Schladming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schladming) station (right by [Krug](https://krugxp.com)) for 4 days in the big city.

Meanwhile, Saskia continued exploring the Dachstein region.

One modification really stood out â€“ as well equipped as the Mammothon was, it had been missing air conditioning. Thatâ€™s now fixed!
