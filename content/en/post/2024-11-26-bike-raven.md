Now that [we‚Äôve passed our motorcycle license](/en/post/2024-10-27-license-a.md), we were able to take our time and choose a second motorcycle without any constraints like "must be big enough for Class A" and also take it for a test ride.

Several models made it to the shortlist, but we ultimately chose our [üê¶‚Äç‚¨õ Raven](/en/vehicles/motorcycle2-raven/), a [Husqvarna 401 Svartpilen 2024](https://www.husqvarna-motorcycles.com/de-de/models/naked/svartpilen/svartpilen-401-2024.html). Compared to our [CFMoto 700CL-X Adventure](/en/vehicles/motorcycle1-kazuko/), everything is a size smaller ‚Äì making it lighter, more agile, and more economical.

Despite the November weather, we managed to take both bikes on their first trip together to an American diner. As different as the two motorcycles are, each is incredibly fun in its own way.
