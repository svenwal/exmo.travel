## Oosterbeek, Wandeltocht (and Windsor)

Once again, we are guided by my appointments – I have meetings in England ([Windsor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windsor,_Berkshire)) and ask a colleague from the Netherlands how he actually gets there. After a quick exchange, we drive to his hometown [Oosterbeek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oosterbeek) and then travel together by train to [Schiphol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amsterdam_Airport_Schiphol) to fly to London.

While I go through meetings and team-building activities in Windsor, Saskia explores the area and finds beautiful nature and a fantastic castle.

Meanwhile in Windsor, I enjoy the typical local weather – the cough I pick up here will follow me for several months...

## Airborne Wandeltocht

When we booked the [campsite](https://www.aanveluwe.nl/), it wasn’t possible to reserve beyond Friday. It turned out that that weekend was [the big day of the year](https://airbornewandeltocht.nl/en/). A huge WWII memorial event because [Operation Market Garden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Market_Garden) took place here (some may know it from the movie ["A Bridge Too Far"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Bridge_Too_Far_(film))).

In commemoration, people come from all over the world and [undertake a walk in memory of the paratroopers](https://airbornewandeltocht.nl/en/). So we quickly adjusted plans, found a [small pitch in Arnhem](https://welderen.nl/overnachtingsarrangementen), stayed there for the weekend, and signed up for the 25km route.

What an experience – the whole town is out and either walks along or supplies the hikers with food, drink, and music. We’ve already walked several [Mammutmarsch](https://mammutmarsch.de/) events (which is also where Manni, our mascot, and the name Mammothon come from) – but this is on a whole different scale – simply amazing.

The route

Since Lou sprained her leg the day before, she went the entire distance with the wagon.

Note: Next time bring WD40 – as cute as everyone found Lou, after a few kilometers the axle started to squeak and the fun went down. But also note: an oil-based moisturizer works for a while as a substitute.
