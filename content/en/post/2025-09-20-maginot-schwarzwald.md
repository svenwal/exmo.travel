    We drive through France, stop at the flooding system of the [Maginot Line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maginot_Line), visit a [fortress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ouvrage_de_Schoenenbourg), squeeze through a narrow road in the Black Forest, visit Sigmaringen, and Sven presses the wrong button...

## Maginot Line – Flooding System

We start a historical excursion, and the first stop on the way to [Fortress Schoenenbourg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ouvrage_de_Schoenenbourg) is a parking spot by a lake. It turns out that even here we are already right in the middle of history, because this dammed lake is actually part of the [Maginot Line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maginot_Line). The valley was meant to be flooded if the German army crossed the border.

## Maginot Line – Fortress Schoenenbourg

We continue to [one of the huge fortresses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ouvrage_de_Schoenenbourg) of the [Maginot Line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maginot_Line). [Fortress Schoenenbourg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ouvrage_de_Schoenenbourg) has been extensively restored and can now be visited. It’s incredible what France built here to create a bulwark against Nazi Germany. You can only partially capture it in photos, but we spent several hours underground and walked several kilometers — all within a single fortress.

By the way: dogs are generally not allowed — unless you carry them the entire time.

By the way, this fortress was never captured during the war — it only fell into German Nazi hands after the capitulation.

## Alsace – Lorraine

While I am again hosting full-day workshops for the company, Saskia and Lou hike up to a lookout tower and capture the beautiful surroundings here.

## Black Forest and Sigmaringen

Back in Germany, we follow the (truck) navigation system to a parking spot. The access is adventurous via a narrow and steep old-town street. We lean out of the windows on both sides and squeeze our way narrowly between cars parked on both sides (despite no-parking signs…). Later I read on [Park4Night](https://park4night.com/de/place/35422) that smaller vehicles have already picked up scratches here — we didn’t :)

Our last stop before another visit to the Allgäu is [Sigmaringen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigmaringen), where we explore the old town and especially the [castle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigmaringen_Castle).

## One more thing

On the last few kilometers before [Kempten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kempten), we make a stop for a customer appointment (online meeting), and while I’m waiting for my turn, I casually click this nice-looking “Update me” button in [Victron VRM](https://www.victronenergy.com/panel-systems-remote-monitoring/vrm). Let me put it in Stephan’s words: “that was not a good idea.”

After that, the inverter is out of service (but the PV system continues to work, so the meeting went through just fine) — meaning no more power from the batteries, no 230V — only the power currently coming in from the solar panels…

More on that in the next blog post, including several hundred extra kilometers caused by stupidity…
